# **Pomodoro study app**
### Author Note

My responsibility in this team project consisted of the 'group' aspect, creating the functionality and the visual pages for the group chatrooms. Each chatroom had four main components; the timer, which was sychronised across multiple clients using *Firebase Realtime* database; the task list, which was highly interactive; the chatbox, where groups could talk and share ideas real-time; and shared notes, where students could join forces to collaborate on their notes and see updates live. This component was highly interactive, with many functions required to work seamlessly and in real-time. It was a challenging experience that I thoroughly enjoyed. A special note to my team members whom, thanks to their efforts, allowed us to make a fun and useful project and receive a high mark.

## **Overview**

This Pomodoro Study App is a web-app developed by our team, **"Team Prodigy"**, using *JavaScript React, HTML, Bootstrap* and *Firebase*.

This project was a part of our module, **Software Project CS353C**, in Maynooth University, National University of Ireland Maynooth. 
This module is worth 5 credits.

This application was designed inline with **AGILE** methodologies to be a study aid for users as individuals or as groups with the main aspect being the **Pomodoro Timer**. Beyond this, each user has the ability to create an account to access a personal dashboard, write notes, add friends and even study together in group spaces. We used **Google Firebase** to authenticate users as well as store our project data. This app has limitless possibilities for further development, such as implementing music from Spotify or adding background noise, or even data tracking to create analysis on study patterns. We added a rudimentary leaderboard system, where friends can compare and compete to reach the top with the highest study time. This application was well-received by our advisors and commended for the hard work and impressive components put into it.
